**Date:** January 4, 2026  
**Objective:** Remove contradictory language, align all messaging, keep site timeless

## ✅ **Global Changes Applied**

### **1. SOI Completion Time**
**Old:** "10-15 minutes" or variations  
**New:** "Estimated time: 5 minutes"  
**Supporting line:** "Short, direct, and intentionally lightweight."

**Updated in:**
- ✅ SOI site (soi.rubberarmstrong.com)
- ✅ Home page
- ✅ Join page

---

### **2. "I Want to Join" Timing**
**Old:** "after ticket sales" (vague)

**Context:** "In recent years, the Steward Sale has taken place in mid-March."

**Updated in:**
- ✅ Home page
- ✅ Join page

---

### **3. What SOI Collects (Standardized)**
**New standardized copy:**

**Updated in:**
- ✅ Home page
- ✅ Join page

---

### **4. SOI Disclaimers (Simplified)**
**Old:** Multiple verbose disclaimers repeated throughout  
**New (top of SOI):** "This is not a Burning Man ticket. This is not a guarantee of placement. Submitting a Statement of Intent starts a review process, nothing more."  
**New (bottom of SOI):** "Everyone who submits a Statement of Intent will be contacted after the Steward Sale, either with an offer to join or a notice that this year is not the right fit."

**Removed:**
- ❌ Duplicated "not a ticket" disclaimers
- ❌ "This is the beginning of a conversation" (replaced with clearer language)

**Updated in:**
- ✅ SOI site

### **5. Contact Expectations**
**Old:** "We may not contact everyone" / "4-8 week review period"

**Updated in:**
- ✅ SOI site (bottom of form)

- ✅ Join page (Timing section)

---

### **6. Ticketing Page**
**Old:** "This page will be updated immediately" / "We will mirror confirmed information here as soon as it is released"  
**New:** "As soon as Burning Man publishes official ticket information, this page will be updated as quickly as possible."

**Removed:**
- ❌ Promises of "immediate" updates
- ❌ Redundant timestamp language
