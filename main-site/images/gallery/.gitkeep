## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG preferred (Cloudflare will serve WebP/AVIF automatically)
- **Size**: 1200-1600px wide recommended
- **Quality**: 80-85% JPG compression
- **Naming**: Descriptive names (e.g., `build-crew-setup.jpg`, `solar-array-sunset.jpg`)

## Categories to Cover

Per year, try to include images from:
1. Build and infrastructure
2. Systems and sustainability (solar, water, recycling)
3. Shared moments (Radiance Hour, meals, community)
4. Night life and art car
5. Pack down and leave no trace

## Cloudflare Image Optimization

Once deployed to Cloudflare Pages, images will automatically be:
- Optimized for size
- Converted to WebP/AVIF for supported browsers
- Served via CDN for fast global delivery

No build step required!
