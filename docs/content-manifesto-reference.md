## Camp Identity & Origin

**Established**: 2015

**Tagline/Opening Statement**:
Named in cosmic tribute to humanity's giant leap, Rubber Armstrong honours a crew whose arms need barely twisting to launch spontaneously into journeys of wonder. Like astronauts bound not for the stars, but for adventures wild and whimsical, we eagerly orbit moments that stretch our imaginations. Welcome aboard - you've joined a voyage where every "yes" ignites the engines of unforgettable escapades.

## Core Values & Ethos

### We Are a Weird and Wonderful Family

We support each other, we are not a burden, we respect each other and work together to co-exist harmoniously.

### Consent

Consent means asking first and respecting the answer; every time, no exceptions. A "maybe" is a "no," and silence isn't a "yes."

### Respect

Respect means treating people, art, and space like they matter; because they do. Leave no trace, take no liberty, and honour the effort behind every creation and every connection.

### All for One and One for All

Everyone plays their part in the success of the camp. We work together as a collective, supporting each other throughout the burn.

### Leave No Trace

Every member follows the ethos Leave No Trace, which is one of 10 Principles of Burning Man. Burners refer to anything that is not originally a part of the land as MOOP (Matter Out Of Place), which includes everything from cans to cigarette ash.

As a camp, we make a conscious effort to clean up, not just after ourselves but everyone around us. There will be constant reminders on this. Don't be offended, be informed.

## Working Camp Philosophy

**Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**

Our family of like minded individuals cannot be run by a couple of people, a community like this requires everyone to play their own part in the success of the camp. We will each need to sign up to 1-2 shifts to cover the roster.

We, as burners, are not individually critiqued but rather as a whole. Together we can improve our participation in Black Rock City, justify our placement, and honour those who have tirelessly worked before us to make our nine days of madness an achievable and desirable goal, year after year.

Everyone's small but meaningful contributions achieve this combined success. Whether it be helping a fellow camp member clean the solar panels, providing excellent banter on your bar shift, or cooking up a storm with a smile. Everyone contributes in their ways, and we are measured as a collective.

## Radiance Hour

**Radiance Grows When Shared**

This year as part of our gift to the playa we will have a daily Radiance Hour.

Radiance Hour is a pocket-sized show-and-tell where any campmate can beam out a skill, story, or hack. Think yoga flows, sound healing, architecture insights, bike-pimping secrets, turning playa tricks into "default-world" magic, or even the fine art of silly noises. Unless a session needs extra elbow-room in the Bedouin tent, it will commence at the same time as the bar shift. Bring your own props; we'll supply cheers, cushions, and an absurdly supportive vibe.

Why step up? Because Burning Man is a city of once-strangers who become family, and every gift you share makes our camp burn a little brighter. One quick demo can spark unlikely collaborations and give you that warm post-gift glow before the night even starts. No sign-up sheets, QR codes, or microphones; just a free-flow audience in a super-casual setting. Whether your wisdom is profound or playful, Radiance Hour is your chance to stamp a bit of you onto the playa and help our community shine.

- Responsible for state of charge
- Responsible for spotters

## Art Car - SS Mezcal

Welcome aboard the SS Mezcal, flagship of rubber-fueled revelry and questionable navigational choices. To ride this vessel is to enter a sacred covenant: respect the art, respect the dust, and respect the captain.

Drivers must be sober enough to explain the Ten Principles backwards, should that arise, and it will. A spotter is required anytime you're navigating the open Playa during a dust storm, in busy areas or creeping through the streets of Black Rock City. In a whiteout? Double the spotters or drop anchor. Visibility is not optional.

When you return the beast to camp, it should not look like it just crawled out of a Mad Max blooper reel. Wipe her down, recycle the cans, refresh the cooler/esky and grab your USBs, coats, bottles, goggles and everything else you stuffed behind the seats. SS Mezcal runs on solar power, good vibes and mutual care. Nothing says Rubber Armstrong family like returning the art car better than you found it. So climb aboard, dance like you mean it, spot like a hawk, and drive like you're part of something that only works because we all give a damn.

## Sustainability & Infrastructure

### Water

Our fresh water totes arrive topped to the brim with 5,000L of filtered drinking water which is more than enough to cover the burner guidelines of 4L litres per day with plenty of contingency for heat-wave refills or those inevitable "forgot-my-electrolytes" chug-offs.

The remaining water allows for a daily disciplined one-minute "playa" shower. This is basically a wet your self, lather up, wash it off and rinse. We will provide burner-friendly Dr Bronner's soap and eco-friendly shampoo and conditioner.

**Water is the driving force of all nature.**

### Power & Accommodation

We will live in temporary homes designed by Rubber Armstrong. The tent's spacious design is inspired and improved upon the successful playa startup "Shiftpod," and is built using triple-layered thermal material.

In addition to your tent, we supply a playa-proven, agriculturally designed, aluminium shade cloth that blocks the sun's UV rays while allowing the hot air to escape.

All tents will have 120v power.

**SS Mezcal runs on solar power, good vibes and mutual care.**

### Recycling

Rubber Armstrong provides a clearly labelled recycling system. Everything we consume as a camp is taken out with us when we leave and recycled.

With this in mind, please remove all unnecessary packaging from everything you purchase and recycle it before entering Black Rock City.

**However Small Your Contribution May Seem; It Is Felt...**

## Community & Participation

### Camp Meeting

The camp meeting is at 10 am and will be paired with Mezcal Margies, as tradition dictates. First, we show you around the camp, show you how all the facilities work, discuss best practices and answer any questions. After which our Mother Hens will sign everyone up to shifts.

### Mezcal Bar

Rubber Armstrong provides a Mezcal Bar as part of our gift to the playa. Due to our placement this year in one of the city's busiest areas, most of the booze allowance will go towards stocking the bar; our main gift to the playa. We are all welcome and expected to attend the bar, both working shifts and holding down chairs of course.

The way it usually works at our camp, and Burning Man as a whole, is that members throw in a communal case of beer every couple of days, share everything they have, and what goes around comes around.

**Para todo mal, mezcal, y para todo bien, también**

### Meals

All dinners are vegetarian for health, safety, and environmental reasons. We are not a turn-key camp, however, we do offer an evening meal to make sure you power your burn.

**Home cooked meals served daily**

All meals are pre-cooked and frozen. This way, we can maintain hygiene and minimize waste and effort on playa.

The kitchen trailer is outfitted with a double burner and a multitude of cooking utensils & essentials (oil, pepper, salt, spices) that you are free to use outside of dinner hours.

## Transportation - Rubber Armstrong Express

Due to limited space and environmental targets we have limited car parking space. Please endeavour to carpool where possible and also consider the Rubber Armstrong Express which is a much cheaper way to get to the camp and you can bring more stuff (shopping/bikes) with you.

**The Only Traffic Jam You Will Want to Be Stuck In**

Rubber Armstrong Express tickets are USD 250 return from a Reno Walmart to Playa.
- Departs Reno at 21:00 on Saturday 23 August
- Returns from playa at 11:00 on Monday 1 September

Jumping aboard the Rubber Armstrong Express keeps the whole crew together and trims roughly a quarter of the trip's carbon compared with a swarm of rentals; fewer tailpipes, less dust, lighter footprint, bigger shared adventure.
