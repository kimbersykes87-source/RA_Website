# Tone of Voice Refactor - January 2026

## Summary

Complete site-wide refactor to establish calm, confident, experienced voice. Removed soft community language, aspirational messaging, and Burning Man buzzwords. Replaced with direct statements, clear expectations, and operational focus.

## Core Changes Applied

### Voice Principles
- Shorter sentences. No filler.
- Statements over explanations.
- No apologetic or reassuring language.
- No sales language. Filtering, not marketing.
- Abstract values replaced with observable behaviour.
- Calm authority. Quiet confidence.
- British English throughout.
- No em dashes.

### Language Removed
- "We aim to..." / "We hope to..." / "We try to..." / "We believe..."
- "Our wonderful community..."
- "Shared journey" / "Unforgettable experience"
- "At the heart of everything we do"
- Burning Man buzzwords (unless strictly necessary)
- "Teamwork makes the dream work"
- "Weird and wonderful family"
- "Cosmic tribute" / "Journeys of wonder"

### Language Added
- "We expect..."
- "This is how it works..."
- "People are expected to..."
- "The camp operates by..."
- "This is not for everyone..."
- "This is a working camp. It runs well because people take responsibility." (anchor sentence)
