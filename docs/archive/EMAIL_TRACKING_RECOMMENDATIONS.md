# Gmail Email Tracking Solution for Burning Man 2026 Invitations
## Tracking 299 Recipients - Complete Guide

---

## Executive Summary

To track email opens and link clicks for 299 recipients from Gmail, I recommend **YAMM (Yet Another Mail Merge)** or **Mailtrack** with **Streak CRM** as your best options. Both solutions can handle your volume, provide detailed tracking, and work seamlessly with Gmail.

---

## Critical Limitation: Gmail Sending Limits

**IMPORTANT**: Gmail has daily sending limits that will affect your campaign:

- **Personal Gmail Account**: 500 emails per day
- **Google Workspace Account**: 2,000 emails per day

### Your Options:
1. **Send all 299 in one day** - Well within Gmail's 500/day limit ✅
2. **Send in batches** - Split over multiple days if you want to pace responses
3. **Upgrade to Google Workspace** - If you need higher limits in the future

   - Go to [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)
   - Search "Mailtrack for Gmail"
   - Click "Add to Chrome"
   - Open Gmail and grant permissions

2. **Verify Installation**
   - Look for green checkmark icon in Gmail compose window
   - Tracking is automatically enabled

### Sending Your Campaign (Manual)

3. **Prepare Recipient Groups**
   - Create BCC groups of 50-75 recipients
   - Send in batches to avoid spam filters

4. **Send Emails**
   - Compose your email
   - Add first batch to BCC
   - Send
   - Repeat for all 299 recipients

5. **Track Opens**
   - Go to Gmail "Sent" folder
   - Look for checkmark indicators:
     - ✓ (gray) = Not opened

- ❌ Must manually track who opened
- ❌ No automated reporting
- ❌ Tedious to manage 299 recipients

## Best Practices for Avoiding Spam Filters

### Email Content Tips

1. **Avoid Spam Trigger Words**
   - ❌ Avoid: "Free", "Click here", "Act now", "Limited time"
   - ✅ Use: Natural, personal language

2. **Keep a Good Text-to-Image Ratio**
   - Include substantial text content
   - Don't send image-only emails

3. **Include a Physical Address**
   - Add your camp's address or contact info
   - Shows legitimacy

4. **Provide Unsubscribe Option**
   - Since this is an invitation to known contacts, you can include:
   - "If you'd like to be removed from future Rubber Armstrong updates, please reply with 'unsubscribe'"

### Sending Strategy

5. **Warm Up Your Account**
   - If your Gmail account is new, send smaller batches first
   - Build sending reputation over a few days

6. **Send at Optimal Times**
   - **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
   - **Best times**: 10am-2pm recipient's time zone
   - Avoid Monday mornings and Friday afternoons

7. **Pace Your Sends**
   - Even though you CAN send 299 at once, consider:
   - Sending 100-150 per day over 2-3 days
   - Reduces spam risk
   - Makes responses more manageable

8. **Use a Professional "From" Name**
   - Use "Rubber Armstrong Camp" instead of personal name
   - Or "Your Name - Rubber Armstrong"

9. **Authenticate Your Domain**
   - If you have a custom domain, set up SPF/DKIM
   - Increases deliverability

## Tracking Pixels: How It Works

All these tools use invisible tracking pixels:

1. **What is a Tracking Pixel?**
   - A 1x1 transparent image embedded in your email
   - Unique URL for each recipient
   - When email is opened, pixel loads, server logs the open

2. **When Tracking Works:**
   - ✅ Recipient has images enabled (most modern email clients)
   - ✅ Email is opened in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
   - ✅ Recipient views email in preview pane or opens it

3. **When Tracking May Fail:**
   - ❌ Recipient has images disabled
   - ❌ Email is read in plain text mode
   - ❌ Strict privacy email clients (some newer iOS features)
   - ❌ Corporate firewalls that block tracking

4. **Typical Accuracy**
   - Open tracking: ~85-90% accurate
   - Click tracking: ~95% accurate (harder to block)

---

## Privacy and Legal Considerations

### Email Tracking Ethics

1. **Disclosure**
   - You're NOT required to disclose tracking for personal invitations
   - However, it's good practice for transparency

2. **GDPR Compliance** (if sending to EU recipients)
   - Personal invitations are typically exempt
   - But if you store data long-term, be aware of data protection rules

3. **CAN-SPAM Act** (US)
   - Since this is invitation to known contacts (not cold marketing):
   - You're likely exempt from most CAN-SPAM requirements
   - Still good to include contact info and respect opt-outs

### Best Practice
Add this footer to your email:
```
---
This invitation was sent by Rubber Armstrong Camp for Burning Man 2026.
If you'd prefer not to receive future updates, please reply and let us know.
```

## Monitoring and Follow-Up Strategy

### Timeline for Follow-Up

**Day 0 (Send Day)**
- Send your initial campaign
- Monitor first few hours for delivery issues
- Respond to immediate questions

**Day 2-3**
- Check open rates (expect 30-40% in first 2-3 days)
- Respond to interested parties
- Note any bounced emails

**Day 5-7**
- Review who hasn't opened
- Send gentle reminder to non-openers
- Subject: "Following up: Rubber Armstrong | Burning Man 2026"

**Day 14**
- Final follow-up to non-responders
- Make this your last touchpoint
- Different subject line: "Last call: Join us at Rubber Armstrong"

### Expected Open Rates

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Event invitations to known contacts: 50-70% open rate
- Community/club emails: 40-60% open rate
- Follow-up emails: 20-30% additional opens

**Your Campaign:**
- First email: Expect ~60% to open (180 of 299)
- First follow-up: Expect ~20% more (60 more opens)
- Final follow-up: Expect ~10% more (30 more opens)
- **Total**: 270 of 299 (90%) should see your invite
